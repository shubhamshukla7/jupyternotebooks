1. Load data
	- Make sure to randomize the samples
	- Check if you need to normalize the data (mean: 0, std: 1)
	- [May be] Use Stemmer to normalize data if it is text data

2. Train on each classification algorithm with default params for training data [Notebook # 5]

2.5 [May be] Do a PCA to reduce dimensionality of data [Notebook # 9]

3. Search for best parameters for each algorithm by cross_val_score() and plotting the results [Notebook # 7]

4. Run grid search on the algorithm that has best score from the previous step

4. Get performance metrics (score, precision, recall, F-score) for the best algorithm with the best parameters

6. Plot with best parameters and report performance metrics again
